Chapter 1

tsc main.ts to compile main.ts to main.js
must do after every change
tsc main.ts -w continues to watch for changes, but typically does not work for multiple files

build folder: put index.html, css folder, javascript folder
src: typescript

ts --init (creates tsconfig.json where we have to specify files)
now we can do tsc -w and it will watch all files specified
can change setings in tsconfig like target for older JS, and directories

if you delete ts file, have to delete js file too

Ignore ts files in root by adding "include": ["src"] at bottom of tsconfig.json

noEmitonError: true -- fail to compile if bad syntax
tsc --noEmitOnError -w (to run it once)

Add explicit type on after variable name
